/// The `ConnectionPool` class allows multiple read-only connections to access a database simultaneously in a
/// thread-safe manner. Internally, the pool manages two different sets of connections, ones that are available
/// and ones that are currently busy executing SQL logic. The pool will reuse available connections when they
/// are available, and initializes new connections when all available connections are busy until the max
/// connection count is reached.
///
/// If the max connection count is reached, the pool will start to append additional SQL closures to the already
/// busy connections. This could result in blocking behavior. SQLite does not have a limit on the maximumn number
/// of open connections to a single database. With that said, the default limit of 64 is set to a reasonable value
/// that most likely will never be exceeded.
///
/// The thread-safety is guaranteed by the connection pool by always executing the SQL closure inside a
/// connection queue. This ensures all SQL closures executed on the connection are done so in a serial fashion, thus
/// guaranteeing the thread-safety of each connection.
