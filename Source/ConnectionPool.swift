/// The `ConnectionPool` class allows multiple read-only connections to access a database simultaneously in a
/// thread-safe manner. Internally, the pool manages two different sets of connections, ones that are available
/// and ones that are currently busy executing SQL logic. The pool will reuse available connections when they
/// are available, and initializes new connections when all available connections are busy.
///
/// Since SQLite has no limit on the maximum number of open connections to a single database, the `ConnectionPool`
/// will initialize as many connections as needed within a small amount of time. Each time a connection is executed,
/// the internal drain delay timer starts up. When the drain delay timer fires, it will drain the available connections
/// if there are no more busy connections. If there are still busy connections, the timer is restarted. This allows the
/// `ConnectionPool` to spin up as many connections as necessary for very small amounts of time.
///
/// The thread-safety is guaranteed by the connection pool by always executing the SQL closure inside a
/// connection queue. This ensures all SQL closures executed on the connection are done so in a serial fashion, thus
/// guaranteeing the thread-safety of each connection.

    /**
        Initializes the `ConnectionPool` instance with the connection type, drain delay and connection preparation.

        The connection preparation closure is always executed on any new connection, before the public `execute` method
        closure is run. This can be very useful for setting up PRAGMAs or custom collation closures on the connection
        before use.

        - parameter storageLocation:       The storage location path to use during initialization.
        - parameter drainDelay:            Total time to wait before draining the available connections. Default is `1.0`.
        - parameter connectionPreparation: Closure executed when a new connection is created. Default is `nil`.

        - returns: The new `ConnectionPool` instance.
