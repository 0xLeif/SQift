# Changelog

The changelog for SQift includes information about the each release including any update notes, release notes as well as bug fixes, updates to existing features and new features. Additionally, SQift follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) (a.k.a semver) which makes it easy to tell whether the release was a MAJOR, MINOR or PATCH revision.

## 0.1.0

### Release Notes

This is the initial release of SQift. Things will continue to evolve through the November '15 - January '16 timeframe as more SQift features are added. The goal is to be ready to release the 1.0.0 version around late January '16. The road to 1.0.0 will attempt to follow semver as closely as possible, but is not guaranteed. Until the 1.0.0 release, please pay close attention to the upgrade and release notes for each version.
